# **Start a new phase in my life**

Maybe you’ve already heard lots of news abort Shanghai which has been censored for many times.

Recently, i took some times reviewed my life, maybe this is the time to prepare running away from now on.

To be honest, I am not that kinda patriot guy. Oppositely, I started thinking about going abroad like, more than ten years ago.

But for recent years, especially recent two years, all the media, propogenda and endless censor truely makes me sick.

I am wondering whether we can tell the truth?!

Ageing population, high property prices, 996, is there any one or any gv took care of this?

Then the last straw is the epidemic in ShangHai.(Can any gv be worse like this?)

>   I used to think that ShangHai can be the last wise gv in cn, as least.

Anyway, this passage can be no point, but can be a annocement that:

from now on, i may use all English to memo and share passages.

And thank god, we citizens in cn can still express opinions via foreigner lang.
