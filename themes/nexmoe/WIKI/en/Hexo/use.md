## Settings

### site_verification

Authenticate your site to the search engine for submitting sitemaps to search engines and managing sites for inclusion by search engines.
```
Site_verification:
   Google:
   Baidu:
```

Get the method of the site_verification value:

1. Log in to the search engine backend. After adding the site, select the `HTML tag` method when verifying ownership. The search engine will then tell you to add something like a string to your page:
```
<meta name="xxxx-site-verification" content="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" />
```
2. Copy the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx string and fill it in the corresponding search engine settings in `topic configuration file`. After the site is redeployed, you can pass the verification.

> If you have enabled `Google Analytics`, you can verify directly in `Google Webmaster` without having to use html markup verification again.
